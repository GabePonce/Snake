1. What went well?
<br>
I had very little issues changing the program to be more class
based and follow the ideas of the four pillars. Overall working
with the tutorial's code was not a particular issue as it was
well explained and layed out.
2. What didn't go well?
   <br>
Not a lot went wrong but there were a couple issues when implementing
multiple snakes and multiple poison apples. At first with the multiple
poison apples only the first one would kill the snake and then I was
having the poison apple like zoom around the screen by accident. With
the adding the second player I was trying to figure out how to get the
controls to work, and eventually I figured that if i moved the inner class
for the key adapter from the game panel into the player class and made
an appropriate constructor it worked out. Also when the objects began
becoming more and more very rarely collision checks would be skipped as
that is all in a sequential fashion.
3. What didn't get done?
- There is still that bug of when there are many objects rarely collision
wont work
- adding a highscore top ten
- making unit tests
- make sure objects don't spawn on top of eachother
